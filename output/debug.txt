   RST (Reset): GPIO 27 (Pin 13)
   BUSY: GPIO 24 (Pin 18)

🚀 Initializing GPIO-only e-ink display (SPI disabled mode)...
🔌 Initializing GPIO pins (following Waveshare Python example)...
   DC pin: GPIO 25
   RST pin: GPIO 27
   BUSY pin: GPIO 24
   CS pin: GPIO 7
🔧 Creating software SPI using GPIO pins:
   MOSI (Data): GPIO 10
   SCLK (Clock): GPIO 11
   CS (Chip Select): Controlled by EPD driver
🎨 Creating e-ink display driver (4.2" b/w/red v2)...
🔧 Wrapping GPIO pins for custom EPD driver...
✅ GPIO pin wrappers created successfully
🔍 Checking BUSY pin state before initialization...
   BUSY pin is HIGH (display may be busy or not connected)
🧪 Testing GPIO pin control...
   Testing RST pin (should toggle)...
   RST pin toggled successfully
   Testing DC pin (should toggle)...
   DC pin toggled successfully
   Re-checking BUSY pin after RST toggle...
   BUSY pin is LOW
🧪 Testing software SPI by sending test bytes...
   Software SPI test completed successfully
🚀 ATTEMPTING REAL EPD INITIALIZATION WITH CUSTOM DRIVER...
   This follows the exact Python epd4in2b_v2.py implementation
   Press Ctrl+C if it doesn't complete within 30 seconds
🔧 Forcing flag=1 for Waveshare 4.2" B rev2.2 module (BUSY active HIGH)
🚀 Initializing EPD (following C EPD_4in2b_V2.c exactly)...
🔄 Performing hardware reset...
   Hardware reset completed
   🔍 Detecting chip version...
🔍 Attempting SPI read (dummy implementation for e-ink)
   📟 Chip version read: 0x00
   ⚠️  Chip version read as 0x00 (read failure), assuming rev2.2+ module
   🏷️  Forcing flag=1 (BUSY active HIGH) for newer modules
   📡 Waiting for display (BUSY pin check)...
   Flag=1: Waiting while BUSY pin is HIGH (new chip)...
   ✅ Display ready (BUSY check completed)
   📡 Waiting for display (BUSY pin check)...
   Flag=1: Waiting while BUSY pin is HIGH (new chip)...
   ✅ Display ready (BUSY check completed)
   📡 Waiting for display (BUSY pin check)...
   Flag=1: Waiting while BUSY pin is HIGH (new chip)...
   ✅ Display ready (BUSY check completed)
   ✅ EPD initialization completed successfully!
🎉 SUCCESS! Custom E-ink display driver initialized!
   The EPD initialization completed without hanging!
🧹 Clearing display and rendering tide chart...
📊 Rendering tide data...
🎨 SKIPPING tide chart rendering for now - focusing on pixel mapping tests...
   📊 Tide series has 145 samples
✅ Tide chart rendering skipped - using test patterns only
🧪 Adding geometric test patterns...
🎨 Adding VERY SIMPLE test pattern for basic verification...
   ⬛ Drawing simple 5px border...
✅ Simple 5px border pattern added - should be clearly visible
📤 Updating e-ink display...
   📤 Sending image data to display...
   📐 Display dimensions: 400x300 pixels = 50 bytes per row
   📝 Sending black buffer (flag=1, commands 0x10/0x13)...
   🔴 Sending red buffer (flag=1, commands 0x10/0x13)...
   🔆 Turning on display...
   📡 Waiting for display (BUSY pin check)...
   Flag=1: Waiting while BUSY pin is HIGH (new chip)...
   ✅ Display ready (BUSY check completed)
   ✅ Display turned on
   ✅ Image data sent and display updated
✅ E-ink display updated successfully (image should persist)
🕐 Keeping program running for 60 seconds to ensure image persistence...
   This allows time to observe if the image blinks, fades, or disappears
   Press Ctrl+C to exit early
   Program completed - image should remain on display indefinitely
   E-ink displays retain images without power
✅ E-ink display updated successfully
